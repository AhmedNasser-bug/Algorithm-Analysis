# Algorithm Analysis

A C# application for analyzing and visualizing algorithm performance through an intuitive GUI.

## Features

* **Core Logic Layer**: Implements various classic algorithms (sorting, searching, graph algorithms, etc.) with performance metrics.
* **AlgoAnalysis GUI**: A Windows Forms interface for selecting algorithms, inputting data sets, and visualizing execution steps and timing charts.
* **Timing and Comparison**: Run benchmarks on different data sizes and compare algorithm efficiencies.
* **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new algorithms to the core logic layer and display them in the GUI.

## Technologies Used

* **C# / .NET Framework**: Core language and runtime
* **Windows Forms**: GUI framework for the desktop application
* **Visual Studio**: IDE and build environment
